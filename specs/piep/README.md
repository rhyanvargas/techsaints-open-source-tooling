# PIEP (Parishioner & Ecclesial Identity Protocol)

## Overview
PIEP defines a **standard identity and data exchange protocol** for parishioners and parishes.  
Think of it as “Google Sign-In for parish life” with a canonical data schema.

## Goals
- Portable parishioner profiles (sacraments, ministries, giving)
- Interoperable parish systems (shared schema, APIs)
- Secure authentication & authorization (OIDC/OAuth2 profile)
- Privacy and consent by default

## Deliverables
- JSON schemas for parishioner/parish records
- OpenID Connect profile for PIEP
- Reference gateway service (auth, consent, audit)
- SDKs for Node, Python

## Roadmap
- v1 Spec draft (Q1)
- Gateway MVP (Q2)
- SDKs + parish pilot (Q3)
