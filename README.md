## üåü Vision
The Catholic Church faces fragmentation in technology: siloed data, duplicated parishioner onboarding, and limited integration with modern digital tools. **TechSaints.dev** unites builders worldwide to create tools that embody the Church‚Äôs mission while solving real-world pain points.

Our work is open source, community-driven, and aligned with Catholic values of stewardship, collaboration, and service.


## üî• Call to Action
> ‚ÄúThe mission of the Church is to proclaim His presence and to serve Him.‚Äù  

By building interoperable, open tools, we make parish life **welcoming, connected, and future-ready**. 

**Join The Mission and let's build!**
